\section{Introduction}

This document is a curated portfolio of algorithmic solutions.
Each selected problem includes:
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0pt]
  \item a brief problem summary,
  \item the key idea,
  \item an algorithm outline,
  \item a correctness sketch,
  \item time and space complexity,
  \item a reference C++ implementation.
\end{itemize}

The focus is on clarity, correctness, and reasoning.
