\section{How This Book Is Written}

This book is intended to mirror how problems are discussed in quantitative development
technical interviews and presented by a candidate on a whiteboard.

The emphasis is on:
\begin{itemize}
  \item stating assumptions explicitly,
  \item building intuition before formalism,
  \item using diagrams where helpful,
  \item sanity-checking results,
  \item (optionally) using pseudocode for simulation-style verification.
\end{itemize}

This is \textbf{not} a formal mathematics text. Proofs are informal, notation
is kept light, and equations are used only when they improve understanding.

Each entry is a \emph{final explanation}, not a transcript of exploratory work.
