# Algorithms Portfolio

A curated computer science algorithms portfolio demonstrating:
- algorithm design and implementation (C++ primary, Python secondary where useful)
- correctness reasoning and edge-case handling
- time and space complexity analysis
- clear technical communication via a compiled LaTeX "book"

## What to look at

- **Portfolio PDF**: built automatically via GitHub Actions
- **Curated problems**: `problems/`
- **LaTeX Sources**: `latex/`

## Scope
This portfolio focuses on high-signal algorithmic patterns relevant to high-end software engineering and quantitative development: hashing, two pointers, sliding window, binary search, stacks and queues, trees, graphs, greedy methods, and dynamic programming.

## Build
The PDF is generated automatically on each push to the main branch. Local builds are supported via a simple bash script.
