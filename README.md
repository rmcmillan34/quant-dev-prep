# Quantitative Reasoning & Interview Preparation

A lightweight LaTeX “book” capturing quant-style reasoning problems in a
whiteboard-first, conversational style.

This repository focuses on:
- probabilistic reasoning
- estimation under uncertainty
- intuition and assumptions
- sanity checks
- optional pseudocode for simulation-style verification

> This is not a trading strategy repository and does not contain backtests,
signals, or performance claims.

## Writing Philosophy

This document captures **cleaned-up reasoning**, not raw working.

Each problem is written as if explaining it on a whiteboard:
- restate the problem
- state assumptions explicitly
- explain intuition first
- formalise only what is necessary
- sanity-check the result
- end with a clear takeaway

False starts, working out, and exploratory calculations are done offline and are not included in the book.

## Build

The PDF is generated automatically on each push via GitHub Actions and committed
to the repo root for easy viewing.
